# ZajalyDocs Workflow

## Creating New Content

1. Check if a related doc already exists (search first).
2. Use the appropriate template from `ZajDocs/Defaults/Templates/`.
3. Place in the correct folder:
   - Tech how-tos/SOPs → `ZajDocs/Guides/[Topic]/`
   - Product-specific knowledge → `ZajProjects/[Product]/`
   - Tool reviews/comparisons → `ZajDocs/Tools/`
   - Blog posts → `ZajContent/Blog/Drafts/`
   - Course lessons → `ZajContent/Courses/[EN|ES|AR]/`
4. Add all frontmatter fields.
5. Link to related docs using `[[wikilinks]]`.
6. If sources are provided but incomplete, search the web to fill gaps.
7. If sources are unorganized, extract into a series of step-by-step pages.

## Editing Existing Content

1. Update the `updated:` date in frontmatter.
2. If major changes, bump the `version:`.
3. Add a changelog entry if the file has a changelog table.
4. Check for broken `[[wikilinks]]`.
5. Verify code blocks still work.

## AI Behavior

- When asked to create a guide from sources, first analyze gaps, then structure as a series of files if the topic is large.
- When asked to create a topic, create an index file + sub-files for each major section.
- Always suggest related existing docs that should be linked.
- Flag any outdated information found during editing.
- Use the templates in `ZajDocs/Defaults/Templates/` as starting points.
