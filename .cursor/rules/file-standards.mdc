# ZajalyDocs File Standards

## Context

This is Zajaly LLC's central knowledge system. The Obsidian vault lives at `ZajDocs/` — all published knowledge goes there. Product-specific docs live in `ZajProjects/[Product]/`. Utility scripts live in `_Admin/Apps/`. Business files live in `_Admin/Business/`. All doc files are Markdown (.md), synced to GitHub, and selectively published via Obsidian Publish, GitBook, Mintlify, Hashnode, and Skillplate.

## Frontmatter (Required)

Every new `.md` file MUST include this frontmatter block:

```yaml
---
title: [Descriptive Title]
type: guide | sop | reference | cheatsheet | snippet | review | comparison | course | blog | template
status: draft | review | published | outdated | archived
owner: Malek
tags: [relevant, topic, tags]
project: general | custojo | waraq | lms | resiboard | repomemo | deployvault
version: 1.0
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
publish: true | false
---
```

## Writing Style

- Clear, direct language. No fluff.
- Use second person ("you") for guides and SOPs.
- Include expected results after each step.
- Add edge cases and troubleshooting sections.
- Link related docs using `[[wikilinks]]`.
- Code blocks must specify language (```bash, ```php, ```javascript, etc.)

## Tags Convention

Use lowercase, hyphenated tags:

- **Topics:** `servers`, `laravel`, `react`, `python`, `databases`, `git`, `docker`, `security`, `ai-ml`
- **Products:** `custojo`, `waraq`, `lms`, `resiboard`, `repomemo`, `deployvault`
- **Types:** `guide`, `sop`, `reference`, `review`, `comparison`
- **Status:** `needs-review`, `outdated`, `work-in-progress`
