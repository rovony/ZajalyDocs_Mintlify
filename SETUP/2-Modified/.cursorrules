# ZajalyDocs — Cursor AI Rules

## Context
This is Zajaly's central documentation system at `C:\Zajaly\ZajalyDocs`. The Obsidian vault is the `Docs/` subfolder only. The full root has 7 folders: `_Admin/` (vault config), `_Inbox/` (capture), `_Sources/` (external refs by topic), `Apps/` (utility scripts/integrations for this system), `Business/` (legal, brand, ops), `Content/` (Blog + Courses), and `Docs/` (Obsidian vault — final knowledge). `Apps/` is NOT for SaaS products — product knowledge lives in `Docs/Projects/`. All files in `Docs/` are Markdown (.md). Synced to GitHub, selectively published via Obsidian Publish, GitBook, and Mintlify.

## File Standards

### Every new file MUST have frontmatter:
```yaml
---
title: [Descriptive Title]
type: guide | sop | reference | cheatsheet | snippet | review | comparison | course | blog | template
status: draft | review | published | outdated | archived
owner: Malek
tags: [relevant, topic, tags]
tool: [tool-name if applicable]
project: general | custojo | waraq | lms | resiboard | repomemo | deployvault
version: 1.0
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
publish: true | false
---
```

### Writing Style
- Write in clear, direct language. No fluff.
- Use second person ("you") for guides and SOPs.
- Include expected results after each step.
- Add edge cases and troubleshooting sections.
- Link related docs using `[[wikilinks]]`.
- Code blocks must specify language (```bash, ```php, ```javascript, etc.)

### Structure for Guides
1. Purpose — what this guide helps you accomplish
2. Prerequisites — what you need before starting
3. Steps — numbered, with expected results
4. Verification — how to confirm it worked
5. Troubleshooting — common issues and fixes
6. Related — links to related docs

### Structure for SOPs
1. Purpose — what problem this SOP solves
2. Scope — who and when this applies
3. Prerequisites — what must be true first
4. Steps — numbered with actions and expected results
5. Edge Cases — what can go wrong
6. Related Docs
7. Changelog table

### Structure for Tool Reviews
1. Overview — what the tool does
2. Pricing — current tiers and costs
3. Key Features — what matters for Zajaly
4. Pros / Cons
5. Verdict — use it or not, and when
6. Alternatives

### Structure for Comparisons
1. Overview — what's being compared and why
2. Comparison Table — features vs tools
3. Analysis — detailed breakdown
4. Verdict — which tool for which use case

## Folder Conventions (Docs/ vault only)
- `Docs/Guides/` — topic-first: Servers, Laravel, React, Python, Databases, Git-DevOps, APIs, AI-ML, Security
- `Docs/Projects/` — SaaS product knowledge: Custojo, Waraq, LMS, ResiBoard, RepoMemo, DeployVault
- `Docs/Tools/` — tool research: Reviews, Comparisons, Setup-Guides, My-Stack
- `Docs/Essentials/` — cross-cutting: Snippets, Cheatsheets, AI-Prompts, Templates, Cursor-Rules
- `Docs/_Archive/` — deprecated content, never published

## Root Folders (outside Obsidian)
- `_Inbox/` — universal capture zone, process weekly into Docs/ or elsewhere
- `_Sources/[topic]/` — external raw material (PDFs, refs) organized by topic
- `Apps/` — utility scripts and integrations FOR this system (NOT SaaS product docs)
- `Business/` — legal, brand, ops (contract templates, brand assets)
- `Content/Blog/` — blog posts → Hashnode
- `Content/Courses/` — Skillplate lesson scripts (EN/ES/AR)

## Cross-Topic Rule
A file lives in ONE primary folder (where you'd look first). Use tags for all secondary topics.
- Example: "Server backup with SimpleBackups" → `Docs/Guides/Servers/Backups/` with `tags: [servers, backups, tools, SimpleBackups]` and `tool: SimpleBackups`
- Dataview: `type:guide AND tags:SimpleBackups` — finds it regardless of folder

## Tags Convention
Use lowercase, hyphenated tags:
- Topics: `servers`, `laravel`, `react`, `python`, `databases`, `git`, `docker`, `security`, `ai-ml`
- Products: `custojo`, `waraq`, `lms`, `resiboard`
- Types: `guide`, `sop`, `reference`, `review`, `comparison`
- Status: `needs-review`, `outdated`, `work-in-progress`

## When Creating New Content
1. Check if a related doc already exists (search first)
2. Use the appropriate template from `Essentials/Templates/`
3. Place in the correct topic folder under `Guides/` or the right project folder
4. Add all frontmatter fields
5. Link to related docs using `[[wikilinks]]`
6. If sources are provided but incomplete, search the web to fill gaps
7. If sources are unorganized, extract into a series of step-by-step pages

## When Editing Existing Content
1. Update the `updated:` date in frontmatter
2. If major changes, bump the `version:`
3. Add a changelog entry if the file has a changelog table
4. Check for broken `[[wikilinks]]`
5. Verify code blocks still work

## AI Behavior
- When asked to create a guide from sources, first analyze gaps, then structure as a series of files if the topic is large
- When asked to create a topic, create an index file + sub-files for each major section
- Always suggest related existing docs that should be linked
- Flag any outdated information found during editing
- Use the templates in `Essentials/Templates/` as starting points
