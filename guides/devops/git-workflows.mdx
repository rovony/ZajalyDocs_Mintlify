Effective Git workflows keep your team aligned on branching, commits, and collaboration. Choose a strategy that fits your release cadence and team size.

## Workflow types

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Trunk-based">
    Short-lived feature branches merge into a single `main` branch. Good for continuous deployment.

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
      main((main)) --> f1[feature/add-login]
      main --> f2[feature/api-endpoint]
      f1 --> main
      f2 --> main
    ```

    Branch names: `feature/<name>`, `fix/<name>`. Merge via PR within 1-2 days.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="GitFlow">
    Long-running `develop` branch with `main` for production. Use for versioned releases.

    ```mermaid
    graph TB
      main((main))
      develop((develop))
      main --> release/release-1.0
      develop --> release/release-1.0
      release/release-1.0 --> main
      develop --> feature/a
      feature/a --> develop
    ```

    Branches: `develop` (integration), `release/*`, `hotfix/*`, `feature/*`.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="GitHub Flow">
    Single `main` branch, always deployable. Feature branches merge directly to `main`.

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
      main((main))
      main --> fb[feature-branch]
      fb --> main
    ```

    No `develop`. Use branch protection and PR reviews.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Conventional commits

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install commitizen (optional)">
    Use Commitizen for interactive commit prompts:

    <CodeGroup>
```bash npm install
npm install -g commitizen cz-conventional-changelog
```

```bash configure
echo '{ "path": "cz-conventional-changelog" }' > ~/.czrc
```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Format your commits">
    Use the conventional commit format:

    ```
    <type>(<scope>): <description>

    [optional body]

    [optional footer]
    ```

    Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Commit with the CLI">
    <CodeGroup>
```bash example commits
git commit -m "feat(auth): add JWT login endpoint"
git commit -m "fix(api): resolve pagination off-by-one error"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update installation steps"
```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Check>Each commit message is scannable and machine-parseable.</Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>Enforce conventions with `commitlint` and `husky` pre-commit hooks. Add a `commitlint.config.js` and run `commitlint` on `commit-msg`.</Tip>
