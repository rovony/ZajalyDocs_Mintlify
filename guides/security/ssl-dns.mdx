HTTPS requires a valid SSL certificate and correct DNS. Cloudflare and Let's Encrypt are common options for free certificates.

<Info>
**Prerequisites:** A registered domain and access to your DNS provider. For Cloudflare: an account. For Let's Encrypt: shell access to the server.
</Info>

## Certificate methods

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Cloudflare">
    Add your domain to Cloudflare. SSL is enabled by default. Set SSL mode to **Full** or **Full (strict)** for origin certificate validation.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Let's Encrypt">
    Use Certbot to obtain and renew certificates. Automatically renew with a cron job.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Manual">
    Upload a certificate (e.g. from a CA) and private key to your host. Requires manual renewal.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Setup steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add domain to Cloudflare">
    Add your domain in the Cloudflare dashboard. Update your registrar's nameservers to the ones Cloudflare provides.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure DNS records">
    Add an **A** record pointing your apex or subdomain to your server IP. Add **CNAME** for subdomains like `www`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable SSL">
    In Cloudflare: **SSL/TLS → Overview → Full (strict)**. For Let's Encrypt, run Certbot as below.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<CodeGroup>
```bash certbot standalone
certbot certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com
```

```bash certbot nginx
certbot --nginx -d example.com
```

```bash renew (cron)
0 0 1 * * certbot renew --quiet
```
</CodeGroup>

## DNS record types

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **A** | IPv4 address | `@` → `203.0.113.1` |
| **AAAA** | IPv6 address | `@` → `2001:db8::1` |
| **CNAME** | Alias to another name | `www` → `example.com` |
| **TXT** | Verification, SPF, DKIM | `_acme-challenge` → token |
| **MX** | Mail servers | `@` → `mail.example.com` |

<Warning>DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate (often minutes with Cloudflare). Plan migrations and certificate issuance accordingly.</Warning>

    Ensure the full chain (intermediate + root) is presented. For Nginx: `ssl_certificate` + `ssl_certificate_key`; include the chain in the cert file.

  <Accordion title="DNS not resolving" icon="globe">
    Verify nameservers at your registrar. Use `dig example.com` or `nslookup example.com` to confirm propagation.
