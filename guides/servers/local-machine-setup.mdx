Configure your local machine so you can connect to the server with passwordless SSH. This is step one of the universal server setup.

<Info>
**Time estimate:** ~30 minutes. **Result:** You can run `ssh your-server-alias` and connect without a password.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

- Server IP address, SSH port, and username (from your hosting provider)
- VSCode installed locally (optional but recommended)
- Basic terminal/command line familiarity

## 1. Configure local SSH

### Open your SSH config file

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="VSCode (recommended)">
    1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
    2. Type **Remote-SSH: Open SSH Configuration File**
    3. Select your config file (usually `~/.ssh/config`)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Terminal">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash Mac/Linux
      nano ~/.ssh/config
      ```
      ```powershell Windows
      notepad "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\config"
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Add server configuration

Add a block like this (replace values with your server details):

```bash
# Your server alias
Host your-server-alias
    HostName YOUR_SERVER_IP
    User your-ssh-username
    Port 22
    ServerAliveInterval 60
    ServerAliveCountMax 3
```

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `Host` | Alias you use to connect (e.g. `ssh your-server-alias`) |
| `HostName` | Server IP address |
| `User` | SSH username from your provider |
| `Port` | SSH port (often 22; some hosts use a custom port e.g. 65002) |

<Check>SSH config file updated with server details.</Check>

## 2. Generate SSH key

### Check for existing key

```bash
ls -la ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

If the file exists, you can skip key generation and go to **Copy public key** below.

### Generate new key (if needed)

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Mac/Linux
  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"
  ```
  ```powershell Windows
  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

- When prompted for file location, press **Enter** for the default (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`).
- For passphrase: **Enter** twice for none, or set one for extra security.

```bash
ls -la ~/.ssh/id_ed25519*
# Should show id_ed25519 (private) and id_ed25519.pub (public)
```

<Check>SSH key pair generated.</Check>

### Copy public key

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Mac">
    ```bash
    pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Linux">
    ```bash
    cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
    # Manually copy the full line
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows PowerShell">
    ```powershell
    Get-Content $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub | Set-Clipboard
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>Paste only the **public** key (`.pub`). It starts with `ssh-ed25519 AAAA...`. Never share the private key.</Warning>

## 3. Add public key to your host

Add the key in your hosting provider’s panel (e.g. **SSH Access** / **SSH Keys**):

1. Log in to the provider dashboard (e.g. hPanel, cPanel, or cloud console).
2. Open **SSH Access** or **Security** → **SSH keys**.
3. Add a new key: choose a name (e.g. "My laptop") and paste the public key.
4. Save.

<Check>Public key added to the hosting provider.</Check>

## 4. Test SSH connection

```bash
ssh your-server-alias
```

On first connection you may see a host key prompt — type `yes` and press Enter. You should get a shell on the server without entering a password.

```bash
pwd
hostname
# Confirm you're on the server
exit
```

<Check>You can connect with `ssh your-server-alias` and disconnect with `exit`.</Check>

## Verification checklist

Before moving to **Server initial configuration**:

- [ ] SSH config has the correct Host, HostName, User, Port
- [ ] Key pair exists (`id_ed25519` and `id_ed25519.pub`)
- [ ] Public key is added in the hosting panel
- [ ] `ssh your-server-alias` connects without a password
- [ ] You can exit and reconnect successfully

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Permission denied (publickey)">
    - Check key permissions: `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519` and `chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
    - Confirm the **public** key was added in the hosting panel
    - Run `ssh -v your-server-alias` and check the output
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Connection timed out">
    - Verify server IP and port (e.g. custom port 65002)
    - Ensure SSH is enabled in the hosting panel
    - Try: `ssh -p PORT user@IP`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Host key verification failed">
    Remove the old host key and try again:
    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -R [YOUR_SERVER_IP]:PORT
    ssh your-server-alias
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
