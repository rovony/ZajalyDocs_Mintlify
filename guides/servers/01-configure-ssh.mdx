Configure your local computer to connect to the server with passwordless SSH. This is step one of the universal server setup.

<Info>
**Time estimate:** ~30 minutes. **Result:** You can run `ssh your-server-alias` and connect without a password.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

- Server IP address, SSH port, and username from your hosting provider
- VSCode installed locally
- Basic terminal familiarity

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure local SSH config">
    1. **Open your SSH config file** — Choose one method:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="VSCode (recommended)">
        1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
        2. Type **Remote-SSH: Open SSH Configuration File**
        3. Select your config file (usually `~/.ssh/config`)
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Terminal">
        <CodeGroup>
          ```bash Mac/Linux
          nano ~/.ssh/config
          ```
          ```powershell Windows
          notepad "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\config"
          ```
        </CodeGroup>
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    2. **Add the server configuration block** — Add a block like this (replace values with your server details):

    ```bash
    Host your-server-alias
        HostName YOUR_SERVER_IP
        User your-ssh-username
        Port 22
        ServerAliveInterval 60
        ServerAliveCountMax 3
    ```

    | Variable | Meaning |
    |----------|---------|
    | `Host` | Alias you use to connect (e.g. `ssh your-server-alias`) |
    | `HostName` | Server IP address |
    | `User` | SSH username from your provider |
    | `Port` | SSH port (often 22) |
    | `ServerAliveInterval` | Send keepalive every 60 seconds |
    | `ServerAliveCountMax` | Max keepalives before disconnect (3) |

    <Note>
    Some hosting providers use a custom SSH port (e.g. 65002). Replace `Port 22` with your provider's port if different.
    </Note>

    3. **Save the file** — VSCode: `Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+S`. Nano: `Ctrl+X` → `Y` → `Enter`.

    <Tip>
    In Nano: press `Ctrl+X` to exit, `Y` to confirm, then `Enter` to write to the file.
    </Tip>

    <Check>SSH config file has the correct Host, HostName, User, and Port.</Check>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate SSH key">
    1. **Check for existing key** — Run:

    ```bash
    ls -la ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    # Expected: file exists (or "No such file")
    ```

    If the file exists, skip to the next step (**Copy public key**).

    2. **Generate a new key** — Run:

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"
    # Prompts: file location (Enter for default), passphrase (Enter twice for none)
    # Expected: "Your identification has been saved..." and "Your public key has been saved..."
    ```

    - **File location:** Press Enter for default (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`)
    - **Passphrase:** Enter twice for none, or set one for extra security

    3. **Verify** — Run:

    ```bash
    ls -la ~/.ssh/id_ed25519*
    # Expected: id_ed25519 (private), id_ed25519.pub (public)
    ```

    <Note>
    `id_ed25519` is the private key — keep it secret and never share. `id_ed25519.pub` is the public key — safe to share with hosting providers.
    </Note>

    <Check>SSH key pair generated (id_ed25519 and id_ed25519.pub).</Check>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy public key">
    Copy the public key to your clipboard:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Mac">
        ```bash
        pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
        # Expected: key copied to clipboard
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Linux">
        ```bash
        cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
        # Expected: single line starting with ssh-ed25519 AAAA... — manually copy it
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Windows PowerShell">
        ```powershell
        Get-Content $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub | Set-Clipboard
        # Expected: key copied to clipboard
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    <Warning>
    Paste only the **public** key (`.pub`). Never paste or share the private key (`id_ed25519`).
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add public key to hosting provider">
    1. Log in to your hosting provider dashboard (hPanel, cPanel, or cloud console)
    2. Navigate to **SSH Access** or **SSH Keys**
    3. Enable SSH if needed
    4. Click **Add SSH Key**
    5. Name it (e.g. "My laptop")
    6. Paste the public key
    7. Save

    <Check>Public key added to hosting panel.</Check>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test SSH connection">
    1. **First connection** — Run:

    ```bash
    ssh your-server-alias
    # Expected on first run: "Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?" — type yes and Enter
    # Expected: server prompt appears (e.g. user@server:~$)
    ```

    2. **Verify location** — On the server, run:

    ```bash
    pwd
    # Expected: /home/your-username

    hostname
    # Expected: server hostname
    ```

    <Check>Connected to server; prompt shows server username and hostname.</Check>

    3. **Exit and reconnect** — Run:

    ```bash
    exit
    ssh your-server-alias
    # Expected: connects without password prompt
    exit
    ```

    <Check>Passwordless reconnection works.</Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verification checklist

Before moving to **Server initial configuration**:

- [ ] SSH config file has correct Host, HostName, User, Port
- [ ] SSH key pair generated (id_ed25519 and id_ed25519.pub)
- [ ] Public key added to hosting panel
- [ ] Can connect with `ssh your-server-alias`
- [ ] Connection works without password
- [ ] Can see server prompt after connection
- [ ] Can exit and reconnect successfully

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Permission denied (publickey)">
    - Run `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519` (private) and `chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` (public)
    - Verify the public key was added in the hosting panel (not the private key)
    - Run `ssh -v your-server-alias` and check the verbose output for clues
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Connection timed out">
    - Verify server IP and port (e.g. custom port 65002)
    - Ensure SSH is enabled in the hosting panel
    - Try explicit connection: `ssh -p PORT user@IP`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Host key verification failed">
    Remove the old host key and reconnect:

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -R [YOUR_SERVER_IP]:PORT
    # Expected: "Host [IP] found: line X" — key removed
    ssh your-server-alias
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="SSH config not working">
    - Verify the file exists at `~/.ssh/config`
    - Check syntax: proper indentation (spaces), no typos in variable names
    - Run `ssh -v your-server-alias` to see which config is being used
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
