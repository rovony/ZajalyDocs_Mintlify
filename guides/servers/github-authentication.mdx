Add the server’s public SSH key to your GitHub account so the server can clone, push, and pull without a password.

<Info>
**Time estimate:** ~15 minutes. **Result:** The server can authenticate with GitHub and access your repositories.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

- **A2 Server initial configuration** done: you have the server’s public key (e.g. from `cat ~/.ssh/server_github_key.pub` on the server)
- A GitHub account

## 1. Add the public key to GitHub

### Copy the public key

On the server (e.g. in VSCode terminal connected via SSH):

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/server_github_key.pub
```

Copy the full line (starts with `ssh-ed25519`, ends with the comment).

### Add the key in GitHub

1. In a browser, go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in.
2. Profile (top right) → **Settings**.
3. In the left sidebar, open **SSH and GPG keys**.
4. Click **New SSH key**.
5. Fill in:
   - **Title:** e.g. `Production Server - your-project`
   - **Key type:** Authentication Key
   - **Key:** paste the public key
6. Click **Add SSH key** and complete any verification.

<Check>The new key appears under SSH and GPG keys with the title and fingerprint you set.</Check>

<Warning>This key is for your **account**. The server will be able to clone any repo you can access and push where you have write access.</Warning>

## 2. Test GitHub connection from the server

From a terminal **on the server** (e.g. VSCode Remote):

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

You should see something like:

```
Hi your-username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

<Check>GitHub responds with your username and “successfully authenticated”.</Check>

## 3. Optional: test clone

From the server:

```bash
cd /tmp
git clone git@github.com:your-username/some-repo.git
# Remove test clone if you like: rm -rf some-repo
```

If the clone works, the server has the right access to that repo.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Permission denied (publickey) when testing">
    - Confirm you pasted the **full** public key (one line) in GitHub
    - On the server, run: `ssh -vT git@github.com` and check which key is offered
    - Ensure `~/.ssh/config` on the server has `IdentityFile ~/.ssh/server_github_key` for `Host github.com`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Wrong GitHub user in success message">
    The key is tied to the GitHub account where you added it. Add the key to the correct account or use a machine user / deploy key for the repo.
  </Accordion>
