Run through this checklist to confirm all Part A steps are in place before you start deploying projects (Part B).

<Info>
**Time estimate:** ~15 minutes. **Result:** Confidence that SSH, GitHub, Git repo, Admin-Server, and binary paths are correct.
</Info>

## 1. Connection verification

### Local SSH to server

From your **local** terminal:

```bash
ssh your-server-alias pwd
# Expected: /home/your-username (or similar)
ssh your-server-alias
# Expected: Connects without password
exit
```

<Check>Local SSH to server works without a password.</Check>

### Server → GitHub

From local, run this on the server in one go:

```bash
ssh your-server-alias 'ssh -T git@github.com'
```

You should see: `Hi your-username! You've successfully authenticated...`

<Check>Server can authenticate with GitHub.</Check>

### VSCode Remote

1. **Remote-SSH: Connect to Host** → select your server alias.
2. Confirm the status bar shows "SSH: your-server-alias" and you can browse the server home directory.

<Check>VSCode Remote connection works.</Check>

## 2. Repository verification

### Server Git repo

```bash
ssh your-server-alias 'cd ~ && git status'
# Expected: "On branch main", "nothing to commit, working tree clean" (or similar)
ssh your-server-alias 'cd ~ && git log --oneline'
ssh your-server-alias 'cd ~ && git remote -v'
```

<Check>Server home is a Git repo on `main` with `origin` pointing to GitHub.</Check>

### GitHub repo

In the browser, open your server repo on GitHub. Confirm:

- [ ] README is visible  
- [ ] `.gitignore` is present  
- [ ] **Admin-Server** directory is present  
- [ ] A few commits in history  

<Check>GitHub repo matches server.</Check>

## 3. Admin-Server structure

```bash
ssh your-server-alias 'ls -la ~/Admin-Server'
# Expected: scripts/, config/, docs/, logs/
ssh your-server-alias 'ls -la ~/Admin-Server/config/'
# Expected: tracked-domains.conf, binary-paths.conf
```

<Check>Admin-Server directories and config files exist.</Check>

## 4. Binary paths

```bash
ssh your-server-alias 'cat ~/Admin-Server/config/binary-paths.conf'
```

Confirm:

- [ ] `PHP_PATH` has the real path (not a placeholder)  
- [ ] `COMPOSER_PATH` is set  
- [ ] `NPM_PATH` is set or marked as not available  

<Check>Binary paths are documented and filled in.</Check>

## 5. Quick verification script (optional)

From your **local** machine you can run a single script on the server to echo status. Example:

```bash
ssh your-server-alias << 'EOF'
echo "[1] Server GitHub key:" && test -f ~/.ssh/server_github_key && echo "  ✅" || echo "  ❌"
echo "[2] SSH config GitHub block:" && grep -q "Host github.com" ~/.ssh/config && echo "  ✅" || echo "  ❌"
echo "[3] GitHub auth:" && ssh -T git@github.com 2>&1 | grep -q "successfully authenticated" && echo "  ✅" || echo "  ❌"
echo "[4] Git repo:" && test -d ~/.git && echo "  ✅" || echo "  ❌"
echo "[5] Admin-Server:" && test -d ~/Admin-Server && echo "  ✅" || echo "  ❌"
echo "[6] binary-paths.conf:" && test -f ~/Admin-Server/config/binary-paths.conf && echo "  ✅" || echo "  ❌"
EOF
```

Adjust key name (`server_github_key`) and paths if yours differ.

## Part A complete

If all items above pass:

- [ ] Local machine connects to the server with SSH  
- [ ] Server authenticates to GitHub  
- [ ] Server home is a Git repo and pushed to GitHub  
- [ ] Admin-Server structure and config exist  
- [ ] Binary paths are documented  

You’re ready for **Part B** (e.g. Laravel deployment, deploy scripts, and project-specific setup).
