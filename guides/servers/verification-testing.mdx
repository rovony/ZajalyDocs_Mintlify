Run through this checklist to confirm all Part A steps are in place before you start deploying projects (Part B). This prevents deployment failures caused by missing SSH keys, misconfigured repos, or incorrect binary paths.

<Info>
**Purpose:** Final verification of all Part A steps. **Time:** ~15 minutes. **Result:** Confidence that everything is correct before Part B.
</Info>

You'll verify connections (local → server, server → GitHub, VSCode Remote), the Git repository setup, Admin-Server structure, and binary path configuration.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connection verification">
    **Local SSH**

    From your **local** terminal:

    ```bash
    ssh your-server-alias pwd
    # Expected: /home/username
    ssh your-server-alias
    # Expected: Connects without password
    exit
    ```

    <Check>Local SSH works.</Check>

    **Server → GitHub**

    Run this from your local machine; it executes the GitHub auth test on the server:

    ```bash
    ssh your-server-alias 'ssh -T git@github.com'
    ```
    Expected output: "Hi username! You've successfully authenticated"

    <Check>Server authenticates with GitHub.</Check>

    **VSCode Remote**

    1. Open VSCode
    2. **Remote-SSH: Connect to Host** → select your server alias
    3. Verify the status bar shows "SSH: your-server-alias" and you can browse the server home directory

    <Check>VSCode Remote works.</Check>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Repository verification">
    **Server Git repo**

    Run from your local machine:

    ```bash
    ssh your-server-alias 'cd ~ && git status'
    # Expected: "On branch main", "nothing to commit, working tree clean" (or similar)
    ssh your-server-alias 'cd ~ && git log --oneline'
    ssh your-server-alias 'cd ~ && git remote -v'
    ```

    <Check>Server repo configured.</Check>

    **GitHub repo**

    In the browser, open your server repo on GitHub. Confirm README, .gitignore, Admin-Server directory, and recent commits are visible.

    <Check>GitHub synced.</Check>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Admin-Server structure">
    ```bash
    ssh your-server-alias 'ls -la ~/Admin-Server'
    # Expected: scripts/, config/, docs/, logs/
    ssh your-server-alias 'ls -la ~/Admin-Server/config/'
    # Expected: tracked-domains.conf, binary-paths.conf
    ssh your-server-alias 'ls -la ~/Admin-Server/scripts/'
    # Expected: .sh files with execute permission (x)
    ```

    Each directory should exist. The scripts folder should contain executable shell scripts used by deploy workflows.

    <Check>Admin-Server structure correct.</Check>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Binary paths">
    ```bash
    ssh your-server-alias 'cat ~/Admin-Server/config/binary-paths.conf'
    ```

    Confirm each variable is set:
    - **PHP_PATH** — real path (not placeholder), matches domain PHP version
    - **COMPOSER_PATH** — path to Composer 2.x
    - **NPM_PATH** — system path, NVM path, or "not_available" if frontend builds are not used

    <Check>Paths documented.</Check>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Automated verification script (optional)">
    Run all checks via SSH in one command. Each line prints ✅ or ❌:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Single-command execution
    ssh your-server-alias << 'EOF'
    echo "[1] SSH Keys:" && test -f ~/.ssh/server_github_key && echo "  ✅" || echo "  ❌"
    echo "[2] SSH Config:" && grep -q "Host github.com" ~/.ssh/config && echo "  ✅" || echo "  ❌"
    echo "[3] GitHub Auth:" && ssh -T git@github.com 2>&1 | grep -q "successfully authenticated" && echo "  ✅" || echo "  ❌"
    echo "[4] Git Repo:" && test -d ~/.git && echo "  ✅" || echo "  ❌"
    echo "[5] Remote:" && git remote -v | grep -q origin && echo "  ✅" || echo "  ❌"
    echo "[6] Admin-Server:" && test -d ~/Admin-Server && echo "  ✅" || echo "  ❌"
    echo "[7] Scripts:" && ls ~/Admin-Server/scripts/*.sh >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "  ✅" || echo "  ❌"
    echo "[8] binary-paths.conf:" && test -f ~/Admin-Server/config/binary-paths.conf && echo "  ✅" || echo "  ❌"
    EOF
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    All eight checks should show ✅ before proceeding to Part B. If any show ❌, fix the underlying setup (SSH keys, config, or Admin-Server structure) and re-run.

    <Tip>
    Adjust key name (`server_github_key`) and paths if yours differ from the defaults.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

## Part A complete checklist

Use this list to confirm everything is ready for Part B (deployment):

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Local machine connects to server">
    SSH config with Host alias, key pair installed, passwordless login working. `ssh your-server-alias` connects without prompts.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Server authenticates to GitHub">
    Deploy key or SSH config configured for `git@github.com`. `ssh -T git@github.com` from the server returns success message.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Server home is Git repo">
    Home directory is a Git repository, pushed to GitHub (private), on branch main. `git remote -v` shows origin.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Admin-Server structure">
    scripts/, config/, docs/, logs/ present. Config folder contains tracked-domains.conf and binary-paths.conf.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Binary paths documented">
    PHP_PATH, COMPOSER_PATH, NPM_PATH in binary-paths.conf with real values (or "not_available" for NPM when optional).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="All verification tests pass">
    SSH, GitHub auth, Git repo, Admin-Server structure, and binary paths all verified. Ready for deploy scripts.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Ready for Part B

When all verification steps pass, the server is ready for Part B: deployment scripts (e.g. deploy.php), Laravel projects, domain tracking via `tracked-domains.conf`, and project-specific configuration. The binary paths in `binary-paths.conf` will be used by deploy scripts when running `php`, `composer`, and `npm` commands.

<Note>
If any check fails, return to the corresponding setup guide (SSH, GitHub auth, Admin-Server, or binary paths) and fix the issue before deploying.

**Part A recap:** Local SSH → server, server → GitHub, Git repo with Admin-Server, binary paths in config. You're ready to deploy.
