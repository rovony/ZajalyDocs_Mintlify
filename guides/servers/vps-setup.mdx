Provision a virtual private server from a cloud provider and perform initial configuration so you have a ready-to-use Linux environment.

<Info>
**Prerequisites:** A cloud provider account (DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr, or similar), a credit card for billing, and basic familiarity with the command line.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a provider">
    Select a VPS provider based on your needs: region, price, and instance size. Popular options include DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr, and Hetzner.

    <Check>You have an account and can access the provider's dashboard.</Check>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a server">
    Create a new droplet/instance in your provider's dashboard. Choose your region, select an image, and pick a plan (e.g., 1 GB RAM, 1 vCPU). Add your SSH key during creation if available.
  </Step>

  <Step title="First login">
    After the server is provisioned, connect via SSH using the provided IP address and root password (or your SSH key):

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Ubuntu">
        ```bash
        ssh root@YOUR_SERVER_IP
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Debian">
        ```bash
        ssh root@YOUR_SERVER_IP
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    <Check>You see a shell prompt indicating a successful connection.</Check>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initial configuration">
    Run your provider's recommended setup script or perform manual setup:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Ubuntu">
        ```bash
        apt update && apt upgrade -y
        adduser deploy
        usermod -aG sudo deploy
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Debian">
        ```bash
        apt update && apt upgrade -y
        adduser deploy
        usermod -aG sudo deploy
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    Replace `deploy` with your preferred username. Ensure your SSH key is added to the new user's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` before disconnecting.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verification

Confirm connectivity and that the new user has sudo access:

```bash
ssh deploy@YOUR_SERVER_IP
sudo -v
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connection refused on port 22">
    Ensure the server is running and your firewall allows inbound SSH (port 22). Check the provider's firewall and security group settings.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Permission denied (publickey)">
    Verify your SSH key was added during server creation, or manually append your public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the server.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Server IP not responding">
    Wait a few minutes after creation for the server to boot. Ping the IP to confirm it is reachable.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
