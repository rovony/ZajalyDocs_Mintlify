Deploy Laravel applications to production with zero downtime using your preferred deployment method.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Connect your server">
        Add your server to Forge (VPS, DigitalOcean, Linode, etc.) and let Forge provision it.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Create a site">
        Create a site linked to your Git repo. Forge sets up Nginx, PHP-FPM, and SSL automatically.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure deploy script">
        Use the default deploy script or customize with `composer install`, `php artisan migrate --force`, and cache commands.
      </Step>

  <Tab title="Deployer">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Install Deployer">
        ```bash
        composer require --dev deployer/deployer
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Initialize and configure">
        Run `vendor/bin/dep init` and choose Laravel. Edit `deploy.php` with your server host, user, and repo path.

      <Step title="Deploy">
        ```bash
        vendor/bin/dep deploy production
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  <Tab title="Manual">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Upload and pull">
        SSH into the server, clone or pull the repo, run `composer install` and build frontend assets.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Symlink release">
        Point the web root to the current release directory; use symlinks for zero-downtime swaps.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>

<Danger>
Running `php artisan migrate` in production can cause downtime if migrations are slow. Run migrations during a maintenance window or use `php artisan migrate --force` in your deploy script only after verifying migrations are safe. Always backup the database first.
</Danger>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="502 Bad Gateway after deploy">
    Restart PHP-FPM: `sudo systemctl restart php8.2-fpm` (adjust version). Check that your web root points to `/public`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Permission denied on storage">
    Ensure the web server user owns storage: `sudo chown -R www-data:www-data storage bootstrap/cache` and `chmod -R 775`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Env variables not loading">
    Run `php artisan config:clear` and verify `.env` exists. If using Forge, check Environment variables in the dashboard.
  </Accordion>
