Effective prompts combine role, context, format, and constraints. Iterate on structure and examples to improve output quality.

| Technique | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Role | "You are a senior Python developer" — sets style and expertise |
| Context | Provide relevant code, docs, or background |
| Format | "Return JSON with keys X, Y" — constrains structure |
| Constraints | "No libraries", "max 50 lines", "handle errors" |

<Tip>
Iterate: try a minimal prompt first, then add role, context, and examples. A/B test variations to see what improves accuracy.
