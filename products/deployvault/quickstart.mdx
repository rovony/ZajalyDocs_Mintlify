This guide walks you through connecting your first server to DeployVault, configuring a deployment, and shipping your first application.

<Info>
**Prerequisites:** A DeployVault account, a server with SSH access, and your application code in a Git repository. Sign up at [app.deployvault.com](https://app.deployvault.com).
</Info>

## Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your server">
    In the DeployVault dashboard, go to **Servers → Add server**. Enter your server hostname or IP, SSH port (default 22), and paste your SSH public key or upload a private key for DeployVault to use.

    <CodeGroup>
```bash SSH key
# Generate a deploy key if needed
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "deploy@deployvault" -f ~/.ssh/deployvault_key -N ""
```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Check>DeployVault connects and shows the server as "Connected" in the dashboard.</Check>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your deployment">
    Go to **Deployments → New deployment**. Link your Git repo (GitHub, GitLab, or URL), select the branch, and set the build command and start command:

    <CodeGroup>
```bash Build & start
# Example: Node.js app
Build: npm ci && npm run build
Start: node dist/index.js

# Example: Laravel app
Build: composer install --no-dev && php artisan optimize
Start: php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0
```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Check>Deployment configuration is saved and ready to deploy.</Check>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy">
    Click **Deploy** or trigger a deployment from the CLI. DeployVault pulls the latest commit, runs the build, and starts the app on your server.

    <CodeGroup>
```bash CLI
deployvault deploy --project my-app --env production
```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Warning>Ensure your server has enough disk space and memory for the build. Large builds may fail on constrained VPS instances.</Warning>

    <Check>Deployment completes and your app is live at the configured URL.</Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>
