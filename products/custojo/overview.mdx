Custojo is a <Tooltip tip="Customer Relationship Management — software for managing interactions with customers and prospects">CRM</Tooltip> platform built for modern sales and support teams. You manage contacts, track deals through a <Tooltip tip="A visual workflow representing stages from lead to closed deal">pipeline</Tooltip>, automate follow-ups, and analyze performance—all through a single API.

Clients send requests to the Custojo REST API. The API routes operations through a queue for async tasks and a cache for read performance. All data persists in the database.
